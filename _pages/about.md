I am a computer scientist with a passion for secure systems, backend development, and practical applications of AI.
I completed my MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and earned a First Class BSc from the University of Bristol.
Over the years, I’ve worked in Switzerland, Germany, and the UK, contributing to projects ranging from scalable graph
analytics at Oracle to AI-enhanced phishing training for my master’s thesis.

I enjoy building robust, thoughtful systems and collaborating with others to solve meaningful problems.
In my spare time, you’ll find me playing table football, tinkering with side projects, or diving into simulation games
like Cities: Skylines and Minecraft.
