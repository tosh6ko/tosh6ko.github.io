I completed my MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and earned a First Class BSc from the University of Bristol. Over the years, I’ve worked in Switzerland, Germany, and the UK, contributing to projects ranging from scalable graph analytics at Oracle to AI-enhanced phishing training for my master’s thesis.</p> <p>I enjoy building robust, thoughtful systems and collaborating with others to solve meaningful problems. In my spare time, you’ll find me playing table football, tinkering with side projects, or diving into simulation games like Cities: Skylines and Minecraft.</p> </body></html>
